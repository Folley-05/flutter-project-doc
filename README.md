## Presentation

This contains the documentation of the ESAIP lessons project

In the folder `01-specification`, you will find the specification of the project: it contains the
needs of the customer. But also the constraints and rules that you have to follow for this project.
Read it carefully: [01-specification](01-specification/README.md).

The folder `02-design` is empty and it's where you have to put the design of your project. You have
to explain how you will implement the needs of the customer. You have to explain the architecture of
the system.
